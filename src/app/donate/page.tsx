            Running ChessPecker takes real resources â€” from puzzle generation costs like compute and storage, to scaling the database that keeps everyoneâ€™s progress safe, plus the occasional development push to improve the platform. Every dollar donated helps thousands of players train better every day. Because we donâ€™t run ads or premium tiers, your support is what keeps ChessPecker fast, stable, and aligned with our mission: all training, no fluff. Think of it as chipping in to keep a community tool alive and accessible to everyone.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-400 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Small contributions go a long way. One dollar can cover a month of puzzle storage. Ten dollars keeps the servers running for a week. Twenty-five dollars offsets a big portion of the monthly hosting bill. Your support not only keeps the lights on but also ensures we can keep listening to feedback and evolving the site in ways that match your training needs.
